# MAST on Ethereum

A simple experimental project to implement some of the key functionality of the [Merkleized Abstract Script Tree](https://river.com/learn/terms/m/merkelized-alternative-script-tree-mast/), which is part of Bitcoin's Taproot upgrade.

Specifically:

> Merkle branches let us only reveal the actually executed part of the script to the blockchain, as opposed to all possible ways a script can be executed. Among the various known mechanisms for implementing this, one where the Merkle tree becomes part of the script's structure directly maximizes the space savings, so that approach is chosen.
